# Valet-Car-Prediction---Multilinear-Regression

This is the Kaggle Project. This is second-hand car store data based on one which we have done the prediction using Multilinear Regression. The process explains, how we run through the Data Science Project Cycle. Here the following are being followed to answer the business question:

- Frame the Problem 
- dataset extracts required features/variables to be analyzed 
- Do explanatory analysis Preprocessing and Data Mining and checking the pattern: This further involves eliminating outliers and normalization and log Transformation 
- Partition of data: working on splitting the data into training and testing samples 
- Standardization and checking for mean square error
- resampling technique 
- ( Cross-validation ) evaluation technique
